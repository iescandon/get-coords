This application is a client-side application that provides users with the coordinates of any location. The user can search by the address or name of the location in the search bar and be provided with the latitude and longitude of their search. Results are provided by Google Maps API. To aid the user, users can simply click on the latitude and longitude and have that information copied to their clipboard. Toasts are included to provide the user feedback when they have copied the coordinates or if the locations wasnâ€™t found. Because of the nature of the targeted users, this app is designed to be very mobile responsive and fully functional on even the smallest screens.
